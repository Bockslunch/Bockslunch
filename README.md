Christopher Taylor (he/him)

I have over 10 years of molecular and cellular biology research experience and am now transitioning to a career in Data Science. I recently graduated from CU Boulder with a BS in Computer Science. Presently, Iâ€™m interning with ARLIS at UMD. In the Fall (2025), I will be starting a Masters degree probram at CU Boulder for Data Science. I'm interested in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Large Language Models but I'm willing to collaborate on practically anything to build my skills and get a variety of experience. I also love hiking, cooking, creating art/music, and playing games with family and friends.
