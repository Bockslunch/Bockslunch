Christopher Taylor (he/him)

I have over 10 years of molecular and cellular biology research experience and am now transitioning to a career in Data Science. Presently, Iâ€™m enrolled at CU Boulder in a computer science program and interested in Data Science, Machine Learning, and Large Language Models but I'm willing to collaborate on practically anything to build my skills and get a variety of experience. I also love hiking, cooking, creating art/music, and playing games with family and friends.
